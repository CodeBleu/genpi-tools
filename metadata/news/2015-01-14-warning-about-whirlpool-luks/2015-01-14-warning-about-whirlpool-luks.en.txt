Per this report: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/38550, the currently
stable version of dev-libs/libgcrypt (1.5.4-r1) does not correctly
implement the Whirlpool hash in certain situations - unfortunately
including its use by LUKS.

This upshot of this is that if you have formatted your LUKS container
using the Whirlpool hash (whilst booted from the default Gentoo minimal
install CD), you will not be able to open it again, if you subsequently
upgrade libgcrypt to a version in which the correct Whirlpool handling
is used (e.g. 1.6.1-r2).

To avoid issues with an automatic upgrade of libgcrypt locking you out of
your LUKS container (e.g., when the 1.6 versions are stabilized), you should
determine NOW if this affects you, and if so perform the remedial steps
below.

How to check if the problem affects you:
As root, run (substitute your LUKS path, e.g. /dev/sda5, for /dev/sdZn):
  cryptsetup luksDump --debug /dev/sdZn | grep -i whirlpool

If this reports something similar to:
  # Crypto backend (gcrypt 1.5.4, flawed whirlpool) initialized.
  Hash spec:      whirlpool

then you need to take action. Note first that:
1) if you have not yet formatted your LUKS partition, then this problem
   does NOT affect you; as the instructions on the wiki now reflect
   the use of a different hash; as such, you can continue with the
   install, and safely ignore the rest of this news item;
2) if you are at an early stage in the install, then the simplest course
   would probably be to return to the page
   "Preparing the LUKS-LVM Filesystem and Boot USB Key", and proceed
   again from there (using the updated instructions; these now stipulate
   the use of a SHA-512 hash, which is correctly implemented in version
   both 1.5 and 1.6 of libgcrypt).

However, if you already have significant data on your LUKS partition,
read on:

First, mask libgcrypt so that it does not update and lock you out
by accident. Issue (as root):
  echo '>=dev-libs/libgcrypt-1.6' >> /etc/portage/package.mask

Then, backup any vital data or software on your LUKS partition!

After that, please follow the instructions on the following Gentoo
Wiki page, to migrate your LUKS header hash:

https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sakaki%27s_EFI_Install_Guide/
Migrating_from_Whirlpool_Hash_on_LUKS

The instructions will work even if you have already upgraded
dev-libs/libgcrypt to >= version 1.6, and thereby locked yourself out.

Any questions, feel free to email me!

Apologies for the inconvenience caused by this bug (and thanks
to Dr-peppa for bringing it to my attention).
