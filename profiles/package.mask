# Prevent issue with broken Whirlpool hash in dev-libs/libgcrypt < 1.6
# when used with LUKS (the previous handling is wrong, but an upgrade
# to the fixed version in >=1.6 will break LUKS containers that use this
# hash).
# Please see https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/38550.
# If you did NOT use Whirlpool when setting up LUKS, you can safely
# unmask (add >=dev-libs/libgcrypt-1.6 to /etc/portage/package.unmask).
# If you DID use Whirlpool, then you should change the hash used in the
# LUKS header to e.g. SHA-512, before unmasking and upgrading libgcrypt.
# See e.g.:
# http://www.saout.de/pipermail/dm-crypt/2014-February/003956.html
# for further information. Please make sure you take a LUKS header backup
# before attempting any hash modification, and proceed at your own risk.
#
# NB this is a temporary mask to give people time to address this issue, so
# as to prevent issues when versions >= 1.6 are migrated to stable in the
# main Gentoo repo.
>=dev-libs/libgcrypt-1.6
